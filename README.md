# Algorithms

Some exercises and assignments I complete about the book [Algorithms Fourth Edition](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

The github site is [here](https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4). 

## Assignments

Programming assignments of the [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) on Coursera related to this book.

* Programming Assignment 1: Percolation

   Write a program to estimate the value of the percolation threshold via Monte Carlo simulation.
   
* Programming Assignment 2: Deques and Randomized Queues

   Write a generic data type for a deque and a randomized queue. The goal of this assignment is to implement elementary data structures using arrays and linked lists, and to introduce you to generics and iterators.

## Documentation and Data
